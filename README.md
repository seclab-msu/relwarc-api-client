# Relwarc API client

This repository contains an implementation of [Relwarc API](https://relwarc.solidpoint.net/) client in several languages.
This code can be used as a library or as an example of using the API. A command-line interface is implemented in each of the languages, so the code can be used as CLI client for Relwarc API.
